Requirements


The code is set up in python environment (requires Python 3.7 or higher). Other standard packages involved to run the packages includes:

Pandas, Numpy, Scipy (for array processing)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
Sklearn (for model development)
MNE Library
As described in the introduction dataset, we will need to translate the algorithms/ feature extraction steps implemented in MATLAB to Python. Fortunately, MNE Library implements most of the common feature engineering steps.

To install the MNE library in standard Python Environment:

!pip install mne

Antropy Library
For the non linear features we are using a library called Antropy [https://pythonrepo.com/repo/raphaelvallat-antropy]. To install Antropy

!pip install antropy
